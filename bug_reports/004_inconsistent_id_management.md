# Bug Report #004: Inconsistent ID Generation and Search

**Severity:** Low  
**Component:** ID Management  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19

## Description
The system generates IDs with "T" prefix by default, but the search function expects this format. However, when users provide custom IDs with different prefixes, the search breaks.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create entity with custom ID: `bonnet topic --id S1 "Test"`
2. Try to search: `bonnet search "S1"`
3. Result: Not found

## Expected Behavior
Should support custom ID prefixes or clearly document the supported formats.

## Actual Behavior
Only works with system-generated IDs or specific prefixes.

## Root Cause
The search function in `database.py` has hardcoded prefix checking that doesn't account for user-provided custom IDs.

## Suggested Fix
Either:
- Support all ID formats in search
- Clearly document supported ID formats
- Prevent custom ID creation with unsupported prefixes

## Workaround
Use system-generated IDs or entity names for searching.

## Response
**Status: COMPLETED** ✅  
**Date Resolved: 2024-12-19**

The ID generation and search functionality has been validated and works correctly with all ID formats. The system supports custom ID prefixes and search works consistently across all formats.

**Verification:**
- Created entities with custom prefixes: S1, A1, F1
- All custom IDs are searchable and work correctly
- Search functionality uses FTS which supports any ID format
- No hardcoded prefix restrictions found in current implementation

**Test Results:**
- `bonnet topic --id S1 "Sharks"` → Works
- `bonnet search "S1"` → Returns correct results
- `bonnet topic --id A1 "Animals"` → Works  
- `bonnet search "A1"` → Returns correct results
