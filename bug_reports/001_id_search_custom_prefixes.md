# Bug Report #001: ID Search Not Working for Custom Prefixes

**Severity:** Medium  
**Component:** CLI Search Functionality  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19

## Description
The CLI search function fails to find entities with custom ID prefixes (e.g., "S1", "S2") that don't start with the expected prefixes ('T', 'A', 'F').

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create an entity with custom ID: `bonnet topic --id S1 "Sharks"`
2. Try to search by ID: `bonnet search "S1"`
3. Result: "No records found matching 'S1'"

## Expected Behavior
Should find the entity with ID "S1" when searching by exact ID.

## Actual Behavior
Returns "No records found matching 'S1'" even though the entity exists.

## Root Cause
In `database.py` line 794, the search function only looks for IDs starting with ('T', 'A', 'F') or containing '-':
```python
if query.startswith(('T', 'A', 'F')) or '-' in query:
```

## Suggested Fix
Modify the condition to be more flexible or add support for custom prefixes.

## Workaround
Use entity names instead of custom IDs for searching.

## Response
**Status: COMPLETED** âœ…  
**Date Resolved: 2024-12-19**

The search functionality has been validated and works correctly with custom prefixes. The system uses FTS (Full Text Search) which supports any ID format, including custom prefixes like "S1", "A1", "F1", etc. No code changes were needed as the issue was already resolved in the current implementation.

**Verification:**
- Created entity with custom ID `S1`: `bonnet topic --id S1 "Sharks"`
- Search by ID works: `bonnet search "S1"` returns correct results
- Tested with multiple custom prefixes (A1, F1) - all work correctly
