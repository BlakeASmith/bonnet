# Bug Report #002: Ambiguous Search Results Not Handled Gracefully

**Severity:** Low  
**Component:** CLI Attribute Command  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19

## Description
When multiple entities match a search query, the CLI shows all matches but doesn't provide a way to select one programmatically, making it impossible to use in scripts.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create multiple entities with similar names: `bonnet topic "Sharks"`, `bonnet topic "Shark Species"`
2. Try to add attribute: `bonnet attr --about "Sharks" --type FACT --subject "test" "value"`
3. Result: Shows multiple matches and asks user to be more specific

## Expected Behavior
Should either:
- Allow specifying which match to use (e.g., by index)
- Have a flag to auto-select the first match
- Provide a way to disambiguate programmatically

## Actual Behavior
Shows all matches and exits with error, requiring manual intervention.

## Impact
Prevents automated usage of the CLI tool in scripts and workflows.

## Workaround
Use exact entity names or create unique identifiers.

The ambiguous search results handling has been validated and works correctly. The system provides proper disambiguation with clear user feedback and programmatic options.

**Features Implemented:**
- Shows multiple matches with numbered options
- Provides clear instructions for disambiguation
- Includes `--no-interactive` flag for automated selection
- Displays helpful error messages with guidance

**Verification:**
- Created multiple entities with similar names ("Shark Species", "Shark Facts")
- Tested ambiguous search: Shows multiple matches with clear options
- Tested `--no-interactive` flag: Auto-selects first match as expected
