COMPREHENSIVE SHARK KNOWLEDGE BASE
=====================================

GENERAL SHARK INFORMATION
-------------------------
• Classification: Cartilaginous fish in the class Chondrichthyes, subclass Elasmobranchii
• Total Species: Over 500 known species of sharks
• Size Range: From 6 inches (dwarf lantern shark) to 40+ feet (whale shark)
• Habitat: Found in all oceans from shallow coastal waters to depths of 6,000+ feet
• Evolution: Sharks have existed for over 400 million years, predating dinosaurs
• Sources: National Geographic Shark Facts, Shark Research Institute

SHARK SPECIES
-------------
• Major Orders: 8 orders including Carcharhiniformes (requiem sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks), Orectolobiformes (carpet sharks)
• Largest Species: Whale shark (Rhincodon typus) - up to 40+ feet, filter feeder
• Most Dangerous: Great white shark, tiger shark, bull shark - responsible for most attacks
• Smallest Species: Dwarf lantern shark (Etmopterus perryi) - only 6-8 inches long
• Deep Sea Species: Goblin shark, frilled shark, sixgill shark - found at extreme depths

SHARK ANATOMY
-------------
• Skeleton: Cartilaginous skeleton instead of bone - lighter and more flexible
• Teeth: Multiple rows of replaceable teeth - can lose and replace thousands in lifetime
• Skin: Dermal denticles - tooth-like scales that reduce drag and provide protection
• Fins: Dorsal fin, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, anal fin, caudal fin - provide stability and propulsion
• Senses: Electroreception (ampullae of Lorenzini), lateral line system, excellent smell and hearing

SHARK BEHAVIOR
--------------
• Swimming: Must keep moving to breathe - ram ventilation or buccal pumping
• Hunting: Ambush predators, use stealth and speed to catch prey
• Migration: Many species migrate thousands of miles following food sources
• Social Behavior: Some species are solitary, others form schools or aggregations
• Reproduction: Internal fertilization, some lay eggs (oviparous), others give live birth (viviparous)

SHARK CONSERVATION
------------------
• Threats: Overfishing, bycatch, habitat destruction, climate change, shark finning
• Population Decline: Many species have declined by 70-90% in recent decades
• Protection: Some species protected by CITES, marine protected areas, fishing regulations
• Ecosystem Role: Top predators that maintain ocean ecosystem balance
• Economic Value: Ecotourism generates billions annually - sharks worth more alive than dead

SHARK ATTACKS
-------------
• Frequency: Extremely rare - more people killed by lightning than sharks annually
• Causes: Usually mistaken identity, territorial defense, or investigative bites
• Prevention: Avoid swimming at dawn/dusk, don't wear shiny jewelry, stay in groups

SHARK RESEARCH
--------------
• Tagging: Satellite tags track migration patterns and behavior
• Technology: Underwater cameras, acoustic tracking, DNA analysis

RELATIONSHIPS
-------------
• Sharks have many different species (T1 → T2)
• Sharks have unique anatomical features (T1 → T3)
• Sharks display various behaviors (T1 → T4)
